        <li>Introduction to Html</li>
        <p>1.HTML is a Markup Language
            <br>
o	       Hypertext: "Hypertext" refers to text displayed on a computer or other electronic device with references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader can immediately access. These hyperlinks can lead to different sections of the same document, other documents, or entirely different websites. The concept of hypertext is central to HTML, as it allows for the creation of interconnected documents and is fundamental to the structure of the web..
            <br>
o	       Markup Language: A set of rules that defines how the layout and content should be displayed in the browser. It focuses on the presentation and structure of content.

       <li>Structure of Html</li>
       <p>
        Basic Structure of HTML
        <br>
        HTML documents have a fundamental structure that consists of several essential elements:
        <br>
        Document Declaration Type:
        <br>

	  <b>Doctype html:</b>

    <br>
     This declaration is placed at the very top of an HTML document. It informs the browser about the type and version of the document, ensuring proper rendering. Omitting this declaration can cause the document to be rendered in "quirks mode," which attempts to mimic older browser behaviors.
     <br><br>
     <b>Root Element:</b>

     <br>
	<html>1.This is the root element of an HTML document. It encompasses all the content and other HTML elements.<br>
    <br>

<b>Head Section:</b>
<br>
	1.<b>Head:</b>This section contains meta-information about the document, such as its title, character set, and links to external resources like stylesheets and scripts. Typical elements within the <head> include:<br>

	 2.<b>Title:</b>Sets the title of the document, which appears in the browser tab.<br>
	3.<b>Meta;</b> Provides metadata such as the character set, author, and viewport settings.<br>
	4. <b>ink:</b>Links to external resources like CSS files.<br>
<br>
<b>Body Section:</b>
<br>
	<body>This section contains the actual content of the website that is displayed by the browser. All visible elements like paragraphs, headings, images, and other content are placed here.

       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
        <b><p>Html tags in html</p></b>
        Heading tags in HTML are used to define headings or titles for sections of content on a webpage. They range from 
        <ol>
            <li><b>H1:</b>Largest heading</li>
            <li><b>H2:</b>Second largest heading</li>

            <li>Block-Level Elements:</li>
            <p>Block-level elements in HTML are elements that, by default, start on a new line and occupy the full width available to them. They create "blocks" of content on a webpage
•	Block-level elements such as:

                <li>div</li>
                <li>paragraphs</li>

                <li>ol</li>
                <li>ul</li>
                <li>li</li>

        
            
             
            </ol>
            <br>

        B.Inline-Level elements:
        <p>•	Inline elements in HTML are elements that do not start on a new line and only occupy as much width as necessary. They flow within the text or other inline elements.
